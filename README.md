# Welcome to my final Project for Go!!

I have built a web scraper that scrapes stockx by shoe name and price and stores them into a json file. Also in the program users will be able to input their budget and based on that you will receive a list of suggestions of shoes within that budget.

I built this project because I'm really into shoes and I thought it'd be a great way for those who are trying to get into shoes more but don't have 100s of dollars to spend can do so. 

Hope you enjoy!
